# Rocket check

## Introduction

Welcome to our complex supply chain project using NFTs for product authentication on Polygon. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity of original products, such as Jordan shoes, tees, and more. By using NFTs, we can uniquely identify each product and provide a transparent, immutable record of its origin and ownership.

## Features

- **NFT-Based Authentication**: Each product is represented by a unique NFT, ensuring its authenticity.
- **Polygon Blockchain**: Utilizes Polygon for a secure and decentralized system.
- **Smart Contracts**: Implements smart contracts to automate and secure the supply chain processes.
- **Transparency**: Provides an immutable and transparent record of each product's history.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle complex supply chains with multiple stakeholders.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Forge
- Metamask or any Polygon-compatible wallet

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/siposeduard/rocket-check.git
   cd rocket-check
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Compile Smart Contracts**

   ```sh
   forge build
   ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**

   Ensure you have a Polygon wallet (like Metamask) connected to the desired network (e.g., Mumbai Testnet or Polygon Mainnet).

   ```sh
   forge script script/Counter.s.sol --rpc-url RPC --private-key PRIVATE_KEY
   ```

5. **Test Smart Contracts**

   ```sh
   forge test
   ```

## Project Structure

- `scripts/`: Contains deployment and interaction scripts.
- `test/`: Contains test cases for the smart contracts.
- `src/`: Contains the smart contracts written in Solidity.
